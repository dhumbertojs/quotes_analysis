The Will to Change
bell hooks

Women and children all over the world want men to die so that they can live.

*****

Women and female and male children, dominated by men, have wanted them dead because they believe that these men are not willing to change.

*****

We belong together

*****

Men in patriarchal culture responded to feminist demand for greater equity in the work world and in the sexual world by making room, by sharing the spheres of power.

*****

No one hungers for male love more than the little girl or boy who rightfully needs and seeks love from Dad.

*****

They learn then to settle for whatever positive attention men are able to give. They learn to overvalue it. They learn to pretend that it is love. They learn how not to speak the truth about men and love. They learn to live the lie.

*****

Women who envied men their hardheartedness were not about to tell us the depth of male suffering.

*****

The truth we do not tell is that men are longing for love.

*****

Patriarchal mores teach a form of emotional stoicism to men that says they are more manly if they do not feel, but if by chance they should feel and the feelings hurt, the manly response is to stuff them down, to forget about them, to hope they go away.

*****

There is only one emotion that patriarchy values when expressed by men; that emotion is anger.

*****

Anger is the best hiding place for anybody seeking to conceal pain or anguish of spirit.

*****

men who feel, who love, often hide their emotional awareness from other men for fear of being attacked and shamed.

*****

To create loving men, we must love males. Loving maleness is different from praising and rewarding males for living up to sexist-defined notions of male identity.

*****

In an antipatriarchal culture males do not have to prove their value and worth.

*****

Somehow the test of manhood, men told me, was the willingness to accept this loss, to not speak it even in private grief. Sadly, tragically, these men in great numbers were remembering a primal moment of heartbreak and heartache: the moment that they were compelled to give up their right to feel, to love, in order to take their place as patriarchal men.

*****

we knew one fact for certain: we could not be and act the way we wanted to, doing what we felt like. It was clear to us that our behavior had to follow a predetermined, gendered script.

*****

Yet many female-headed households endorse and promote patriarchal thinking with far greater passion than two-parent households. Because they do not have an experiential reality to challenge false fantasies of gender roles, women in such households are far more likely to idealize the patriarchal male role and patriarchal men than are women who live with patriarchal men every day.

*****

But the most common forms of patriarchal violence are those that take place in the home between patriarchal parents and children. The

*****

As long as men are brainwashed to equate violent domination and abuse of women with privilege, they will have no understanding of the damage done to themselves or to others, and no motivation to change.

*****

Boys brutalized and victimized by patriarchy more often than not become patriarchal, embodying the abusive patriarchal masculinity that they once clearly recognized as evil.

*****

The laughter is itself a weapon of patriarchal terrorism.

*****

Patriarchy as a system has denied males access to full emotional well-being, which is not the same as feeling rewarded, successful, or powerful because of one’s capacity

*****

to assert control over others.

*****

The crisis facing men is not the crisis of masculinity, it is the crisis of patriarchal masculinity.

*****

Psychological patriarchy is the dynamic between those qualities deemed “masculine” and “feminine” in which half of our human traits are exalted while the other half is devalued.

*****

To end patriarchy we must challenge both its psychological and its concrete manifestations in daily life.

*****

We cannot teach boys that “real men” either do not feel or do not express feelings, then expect boys to feel comfortable getting in touch with their feelings.
Much of the traditional

*****

Instead these books imply that within the existing patriarchal system, boyhood should be free of patriarchal demands. The value of patriarchy itself is never addressed.

*****

Many antipatriarchal parents find that the alternative masculinities they support for their boy children are shattered not by grown-

*****

ups but by sexist male peers.

*****

What has been all but impossible to change is widespread cultural patriarchal propaganda. Yet we begin to protect the emotional well-being of boys and of all males when we call this propaganda by its true name, when we acknowledge that patriarchal culture requires that boys deny, suppress, and if all goes well, shut down their emotional awareness and their capacity to feel.

*****

Those rare boys who happen to live in antipatriarchal homes learn early to lead a double life: at home they can feel and express and be; outside the home they must conform to the role of patriarchal boy.

*****

Since patriarchal parenting does not teach boys to express their feelings in words, either boys act out or they implode.

*****

In healthy families boys are able to learn and assert autonomy without engaging in antisocial behavior, without isolating themselves.

*****

In isolation they lose the sense of their value and worth.

*****

Boys are encouraged by patriarchal thinking to claim rage as the easiest path to manliness.

*****

Much of the anger boys express is itself a response to the demand that they not show any other emotions.

*****

Anger can be, and usually is, the hiding place for fear and pain.

*****

At a time in our nation’s history when more boys than ever are being raised in single-parent, female-headed homes, mass media send the message that a single mother is unfit to raise a healthy boy child.

*****

Homophobia underlies the fear that allowing boys to feel will turn them gay; this fear is often most intense in single-parent homes.

*****

they use various techniques of psychological terrorism, the primary one being the practice of shaming. Patriarchal fathers cannot love their sons because the rules of patriarchy dictate that they stand in competition with their sons, ready to prove that they are the real man, the one in charge.

*****

Without a positive connection to a real adult man, they are far more likely to invest in a hypermasculine patriarchal ideal.

*****

It may give them a sense of quest and purpose to feel they will someday find the father or, through having children, become the father they dream about.

*****

As much as grown-ups complain about adolescent male anger, most adults are more comfortable confronting a raging teenager than one who is overwhelmed by sorrow and cannot stop weeping.

*****

Boys learn to cover up grief with anger; the more troubled the boy, the more intense the mask of indifference.

*****

Shutting down emotionally is the best defense when the longing for connection must be denied.

*****

If boys take their rage and sit in front of a computer all day, never speaking, never relating, no one cares.

*****

If boys take their rage to the mall, no one cares, as long as it is contained.

*****

Much of the mass media directed at young male consumers is created by self-hating, emotionally shutdown adult men who have only the pornography of violence to share with younger men.

*****

While feminism may ignore boys and young males, capitalist patriarchal men do not.

*****

To truly protect and honor the emotional lives of boys we must challenge patriarchal culture. And until that culture changes, we must create the subcultures, the sanctuaries where boys can learn to be who they are uniquely, without being forced to conform to patriarchal masculine visions.

*****

One of the truths that cannot be spoken is the daily violence enacted by men of all classes and races in our society—the violence of emotional abuse.

*****

Significantly, emotional abuse in families is not just a component of the couple bond; it can determine the way everyone in a family relates.

*****

They both felt that all attempts at reconciliation should have come from the father to the son. And yet as they matured into manhood, both these men began to behave not unlike the fathers whose actions they had condemned and hated.

*****

When I first began looking at gender issues, I believed that violence was a by-product of boyhood socialization. But after listening more closely to men and their families, I have come to believe that violence is boyhood socialization. The way we “turn boys into men” is through injury: We sever them from their mothers, research tells us, far too early

*****

Disconnection is not fallout from traditional masculinity. Disconnection is masculinity.

*****

Contrary to popular myths, single mothers are often the most brutal when it comes to coercing their sons to conform to patriarchal standards.

*****

In patriarchal culture boys learn early that the authority of the mother is limited, that her power comes solely from being a caretaker of patriarchy.

*****

Mothers who ally themselves with patriarchy cannot love their sons rightly, for there will always come a moment when patriarchy will ask them to sacrifice their sons.

*****

Ever since I started writing about love, I have defined it in a way that blends M. Scott Peck’s notion of love as the will to nurture one’s own and another’s spiritual and emotional growth, with Eric Fromm’s insight that love is action and not solely feeling.

*****

Working with men who wanted to know love, I have advised them to think of it as a combination of care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust. Most

*****

The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves.

*****

Emotionally self-mutilated, disconnected, many men make overtures of emotional connection only to later undermine these with emotional abuse.

*****

Collective female acceptance of male violence in love relationships, even if the appearance of acceptance masks rage, fear, or outright terror, makes it difficult to challenge and change male violence.

*****

If only one party in a relationship is working to create love, to create the space of emotional connection, the dominator model remains in place and the relationship just becomes a site for continuous power struggle.

*****

As it is for many men today, it was much easier for him to accept equal pay for equal work, sharing housework, and reproductive rights than it was for him to accept the need for shared emotional development. It is more difficult for men to do the work of emotional development because this work requires individuals to be emotionally aware—to feel.

*****

Men who win on patriarchal terms end up losing in terms of their substantive quality of life.

*****

Male violence in general has intensified not because feminist gains offer women greater freedom but rather because men who endorse patriarchy discovered along the way that the patriarchal promise of power and dominion is not easy to fulfill, and in those rare cases where it is fulfilled, men find themsel

*****

ves emotionally bereft

*****

It is not easy for males, young or old, to reject the codes of patriarchal masculinity. Men who choose against violence are simultaneously choosing against patriarchy, whether they can articulate that choice or not.

*****

Ultimately the men who choose against violence, against death, do so because they want to live fully and well, because they want to know love.

*****

In actuality, men come to sex hoping that it will provide them with all the emotional satisfaction that would come from love.

*****

I realized that it was practically impossible to have a serious discussion about love—that discussions of love, especially public conversations, are taboo in our society. Yet everyone talks about sex.

*****

No matter how many men in our nation are celibate or have only occasional sexual experiences, people still believe that sex is something men have to have.

*****

The assumption that “he’s gotta have it” underlies much of our culture’s acceptance of male sexual violence.

*****

Children today learn more about sex from mass media than from any other source.

*****

Males, whether gay or straight, learn early on in life that one of the primary rewards offered to them for obedience to patriarchal thought and practice is the right to dominate females sexually.

*****

Within a culture of domination struggles for power are enacted daily in human relationships, often assuming their worst forms in situations of intimacy.

*****

Men who do not daily lie and cheat at their jobs do so in their intimate bonds

*****

Sex is where many men act out because it is the only social arena where the patriarchal promise of dominion can be easily realized. Without these perks, masses of men might have rebelled against patriarchy long ago.

*****

They learn early that sexual desire should not be freely expressed and that females will try to control male sexuality.

*****

For boys this issue of control begins with the mother’s response

*****

to his penis; usually she does not like it and she does not know what to do with it. Her discomfort with his penis communicates that there is something inherently wrong with it. She does not communicate to the boy child that his penis is wonderful, special, marvelous. This same fear of the boy’s penis is commonly expressed by fathers who simply do not concern themselves with educating boys about their bodies.

*****

In patriarchal culture everyone is encouraged to see the penis, even the penis of a small boy, as a potential weapon. This is the psychology of a rape culture.

*****

Hence the underlying message boys receive about sexual acts is that they will be destroyed if they are not in control, exercising power.

*****

Sexual repression fuels the lust of boys and men.

*****

Despair and rage are the feelings men bring to sex, whether with women or with other men.

*****

Encouraged to relate to sex in an addictive way by the patriarchal thinking which says “he’s gotta have it,” males must then adjust to a world where they can rarely get it, or never get it as much as they want, or where they can get it only by coercing and manipulating someone who does not want it, usu

*****

ally someone female

*****

It is not about connecting to someone else but rather about releasing their own pain. The addict is often an individual in acute pain.

*****

Patriarchal men have no outlet to express their pain, so they simply seek release.

*****

Male sexual obsession tends to be seen as normal. Thus the culture as a whole colludes in requiring of men that they discount and disown their feelings, displacing them all onto sex.

*****

patriarchal pornography available in myriad forms becomes the site of sublimation, the place where the sexual addict can get a quick fix. Patriarchal men can do pornography anywhere all day long.

*****

Kimmel contends that male consumption of pornography is fed by the sexual lust males are taught to feel all the time and their rage that this lust cannot be satisfied:

*****

Pornography can sexualize that rage, and it can make sex look like revenge…. Everywhere, men are in power, controlling virtually all the economic, political, and social institutions of society. Yet individual men do not feel powerful—far from it.

*****

Many men are angry at women, but more profoundly, women are the targets for displaced male rage at the failure of patriarchy to make good on its promise of fulfillment, especially endless sexual fulfillment.

*****

Rather than seeing the violence men do as an expression of power, we would need to call it by its true name—pathology.

*****

Patriarchal violence is a mental illness.

*****

What matters in patriarchal sex is the male need to fuck.

*****

Attention to the meaning of the central male slang term for sexual intercourse—“fuck”—is instructive.
--
Esto se replica para todos los lenguajes?

*****

the truth of men’s lives is that patriarchal sexuality has not satisfied. It has fueled the compulsive need to be more sexual, to be more violent in the hopes that

*****

there is a way to be more satisfied.

*****

Patriarchal pornography has become an inescapable part of everyday life because the need to create a pretend culture where male sexual desire is endlessly satisfied keeps males from exposing the patriarchal lie and seeking healthy sexual identities.

*****

More often than not, gay males, unless they have consciously decided otherwise, are as patriarchal in their thinking about masculinity, about sexuality, as their heterosexual counterparts.

*****

Patriarchal pornography is a space of shared masculinity for straight and gay men.

*****

Tragically, if masses of men believe that their selfhood and their patriarchal sexuality are one and the same, they will never find the courage to create liberating, fulfilling sexuality.

*****

Socializing women to conform more to patriarchal male sexual norms is one way patriarchy hopes to address male rage.

*****

Male despair, often initially expressed as anger, is a far greater threat to the patriarchal sexual order than feminist movement.

*****

Compulsive sexuality, like any addiction, is hard for men to change because it takes the place of the healing that is needed if men are to love their bodies and let that love lead them into greater community with other human bodies, with the bodies of women and children.

*****

To recover the power and passion of male sexuality unsullied by patriarchal assault, males of all ages must be allowed to speak openly of their sexual longing. They must be able to be sexual beings in a space where patriarchal thinking can no longer make violation the only means of attaining sexual pleasure. This is a tough job. And until males learn how to do it, they will not be satisfied.

*****

Before feminist movement boys were more likely to be taught, at home and at school, that they would find fulfillment in work.

*****

Today boys hear a slightly different message. They are told that money offers fulfillment and that work is a way to acquire money—but not the only way.

*****

Nowadays working men of all classes experience periods of unemployment. In order to keep the faith, patriarchal culture has had to offer men different criteria for judging their worth than work.

*****

As a primary foundation of patriarchal self-esteem, work has not worked for masses of men for some time. Rather than throw out the whole outmoded patriarchal script so that the nature of work in our culture can be changed, men are offered addictions that make unsatisfying work more bearable.

*****

One of the antifeminist patriarchal sentiments that has gained ground in recent years is the notion that masses of men used to be content to slave away at meaningless labor to fulfill their role as providers and that it is feminist insistence on gender equality in the workforce

*****

Barbara Ehrenreich’s The Hearts of Men was one of the first books highlighting the reality that many men are not eager to be providers, that the very idea of the “playboy” was rooted in the longing to escape this role and to have another means of proving one’s manhood.

*****

Work stands in the way of love for most men then because the long hours they work often drain their energies; there is little or no time left for emotional labor, for doing the work of love.

*****

Contemporary patriarchy has offered disappointed male workers a trade-off: the perks of manhood that a depressed economy takes away can be redeemed in the realm of the sexual through domination of women.

*****

The movement of masses of women into the workforce has not undermined male workers economically; they still receive the lion’s share of both jobs and wages. It has made women who work feel more entitled to resist domination than women who stay home dependent on a man’s wages to survive.

*****

Most women who work long hours come home and work a second shift taking care of household chores. They feel, like their male counterparts, that there is no time to do emotional work, to share feelings and nurture others.

*****

Most women work because they want to leave the house and because their families need the income to survive, not because they are feminists who believe that their working is a sign of liberation.

*****

Most men continue to uphold the sexist decree that emotions have no place in the work world and that emotional labor at home should be done by females.

*****

most men have such a limited sense of self that they are uncertain that they possess “selves we could want to relate to.” He contends, “We only seem to learn that the ‘self’ is something we have to control tightly, since otherwise it might upset our plans…. We never really give ourselves much chance to know ourselves better or develop more contact with ourselves, since…all this threatens the ‘control’ we have been brought up to identify our masculinity with.

*****

when men gather together at work, they rarely have meaningful conversations. They jeer, they grandstand, they joke, but they do not share feelings. They relate in a scripted, limited way, careful to remain within the emotional boundaries set by patriarchal thinking about masculinity.

*****

Just as feminist gains in this nation primarily had a positive impact on women with class privilege, the “working” men who have been given permission within the contours of patriarchal culture to reconfigure the nature of work in their lives tend to have class power.

*****

In Rediscovering Masculinity Victor Seidler states that the male who defines his self through work seeks to do so because “this is the only identity that can traditionally be

*****

long to us…believing we can still prove our masculinity by showing we do not need anything from others.”

*****

In actuality, individual men are engaged in the work of emotional recovery every day, but the work is not easy because they have no support systems within patriarchal culture, especially if they are poor and working-class.

*****

The success of AA is tied to the fact that the practice of recovery takes place in the context of community, one in which shame about failure can be expressed and male longing for healing validated.

*****

When patriarchy no longer rules the day, it will be possible for men to view themselves holistically, to see work as part of life, not their whole existence.

*****

Ornish shares that the practice of intimacy is healing: “I am learning that the key to our survival is love.

*****

Women workers find that leaving the isolation of the home and working in a communal setting enhances their emotional well-being, even when wages are low and in no way liberating

*****

If men followed this example and used the workplace as a setting to practice relational skills, building community, the male crisis around work could be addressed more effectively.

*****

Work can and should be life-enhancing for all men. When daring men come to work loved and loving, the nature of work will be transformed and the workplace will no longer demand that the hearts of men be broken to get the job done

*****

A man who is unabashedly and unequivocally committed to patriarchal masculinity will both fear and hate all that the culture deems feminine and womanly.

*****

Most men have clearly been willing to resist patriarchy when it interferes with individual desire, but they have not been willing to embrace feminism as a movement that would challenge, change, and ultimately end patriar

*****

It was difficult for women committed to feminist change to face the reality that the problem did not lie just with men. Facing that reality required more complex theorizing; it required acknowledging the role women play in maintaining and perpetuating patriarchy and sexism.

*****

The vast majority of feminist women I encounter do not hate men. They feel sorry for men because they see how patriarchy wounds them and yet men remain wedded to patriarchal culture.

*****

Feminist thinking teaches us all, males especially, how to love justice and freedom in ways that foster and affirm life.

*****

Teachers of children see gender equality mostly in terms of ensuring that girls get to have the same privileges and rights as boys within the existing social structure; they do not see it in terms of granting boys the same rights as girls—for instance, the right to choose not to engage in aggressive or violent play, the right to play with dolls, to play dress up, to wear costumes of either gender, the right to choose.

*****

Once the “new man” that is the man changed by feminism was represented as a wimp, as overcooked broccoli dominated by powerful females who were secretly longing for his macho counterpart, masses of men lost interest. Reacting to this inversion of gender roles, men who were sympathetic chose to stop trying to play a role in female-led feminist movement and became involved with the men’s movement.

*****

Positively, the men’s movement emphasized the need for men to get in touch with their feelings, to talk with other men.

*****

Negatively, the men’s movement continued to promote patriarchy by a tacit insistence that in

*****

order to be fully self-actualized, men needed to separate from women.

*****

The men’s movement was often critical of women and feminism while making no sustained critique of patriarchy.

*****

Many of the New Age models created by men reconfigure old sexist paradigms while making it seem as though they are offering a different script for gender relations.

*****

Starting in early childhood, males need models of men with integrity, that is, men who are whole, who are not divided against themselves.

*****

Undoubtedly, one of the first revolutionary acts of visionary feminism must be to restore maleness and masculinity as an ethical biological category divorced from the dominator model.

*****

Rejecting this model for a feminist masculinity means that we must define maleness as a state of being rather than as performance.

*****

Our work of love should be to reclaim masculinity and not allow it to be held hostage to patriarchal domination.

*****

There is a creative, life-sustaining, life-enhancing place for the masculine in a nondominator culture.

*****

Patriarchal culture continues to control the hearts of men precisely because it socializes males to believe that without their role as patriarchs they will have no reason for being.

*****

Dominator culture teaches all of us that the core of our identity is defined by the will to dominate and control others.

*****

When culture is based on a dominator model, not only will it be violent but it will frame all relationships as power struggles.

*****

Before the realities of men can be transformed, the dominator model has to be eliminated as the underlying ideology on which we base our culture.

*****

Clearly, ending patriarchy is necessary for men to have collective liberation. It is the only resolution to the masculinity crisis that most men are experiencing.

*****

To offer men a different way of being, we must first replace the dominator model with a partnership model that sees interbeing and interdependency as the organic relationship of all living beings.

*****

Patriarchal masculinity teaches males to be pathologically narcissistic, infantile, and psychologically dependent for self-definition on the privileges (however relative) that they receive from having been born male. Hence many males feel that their very existence is threatened if these privileges are taken away.

*****

In a partnership model male identity, like its female counterpart, would be centered around the notion of an essential goodness that is inherently relationally oriented.

*****

Feminist masculinity presupposes that it is enough for males to be to have value, that they do not have to “do,” to “perform,” to be affirmed and loved.

*****

feminist masculinity defines strength as one’s capacity to be responsible for self and others.

*****

Currently, sexist definitions of male roles insist on defining maleness in relationship to winning, one-upmanship, domination:

*****

Feminist masculinity would have as its chief constituents integrity, self-love, emotional awareness, assertiveness, and relational skill, including the capacity to be empathic, autonomous, and connected.”

*****

Patriarchy is destroying the well-being of men, taking their lives daily.

*****

lots of women survive leading happy, fulfilling lives because we do not embrace an identity which weds us to violence;

*****

men must have the same choic

*****

Men who are able to be whole, undivided selves can practice the emotional discernment beautifully described by the Masai wise man precisely because they are able to relate and respond rather than simply react.

*****

The power of patriarchy has been to make maleness feared and to make men feel that it is better to be feared than to be loved. Whether they can confess this or not, men know that it just is not true.

*****

Ultimately, one of the emotional costs of allegiance to patriarchy is to be seen as unworthy of trust.

*****

Patriarchal masculinity insists that real men must prove their manhood by idealizing aloneness and disconnection.

*****

Parenting remains a setting where men can practice love as they let go of a dominator model and engage mutually with women who parent

*****

As long as men dominate women, we cannot have love between us. That love and domination can coexist is one of the most powerful lies patriarchy tells us all.

*****

Love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion.

*****

One of the primary reasons the feminist demand that we challenge and change patriarchy had so little impact on males was that the theory was primarily expressed in books.

*****

Gender-based changes in the workforce and in sexual politics meant that sex roles were modified for a vast majority of people, especially females, yet even so, patriarchal notions of masculinity

*****

remained intact, even when those notions did not have a reality base.

*****

Most men chose not to change, and conservative mass media supported their staying in place. Men’s continued allegiance to a notion of masculinity that could no longer be fully realized on the old terms led them to place greater emphasis on their ability to dominate and control by physical force and abusive psychological terrorism.

*****

Compelled to work in a public arena where men no longer asserted patriarchal control

*****

these men could fully enact rituals of patriarchal domination only in the private sphere.

*****

In social relationships with other men outside the sphere of work, men were more compelled than ever to enact rituals of domination. Among black males, black-on-black homicide fast became the leading cause of death for males between the ages of sixteen and forty-five.

*****

The Hulk was the precursor for the Power Ranger toys that are still popular along with more recent video games which allow boys to engage in violent ritualized play.

*****

Like the men of the Beat generation, like the more recent men of Generation X, he is the symbol of the ultimate patriarchal man—alone, on the road, forever drifting, driven by the beast within.

*****

The popularization of gangsta rap, spearheaded by white male executives in the music industry, gave a public voice to patriarchy and woman-hating.
--
Será? Podría ser subconsciente 

*****

mass media demonization of black males as the epitome of brutal patriarchal masculinity deflects attention away from the patriarchal masculinity of white men and its concomitant woman-hating.

*****

The path to redemption requires the repudiation of white-male patriarchal rule.

*****

Contemporary books and movies offer clear portraits of the evils

*****

patriarchy without offering any direction for change.

*****

Until we can create a popular culture that affirms and celebrates masculinity without upholding patriarchy, we will never see a change in the way that masses of males think about the nature of their identity.

*****

His choice to love, to live, is the break with the patriarchal model that liberates his spirit.

*****

Mass media are a powerful vehicle for teaching the art of the possible.

*****

Many mothers in patriarchal culture express their rage at adult men by directing anger at their sons.

*****

David Winter found that women living in countries or periods of extreme male dominance tend to be very controlling of their sons, who are the only males it is safe for them to vent against.

*****

Much of the anger men direct at mothers is a response to the maternal failure to protect the spirit of the boy from patriarchal harm.

*****

Every day mothers are ruthlessly and brutally terminating their emotional connection with male children in order to turn them over to patriarchy, whether to an actual unfeeling father or to a symbolic father. Boys feel the pain. And they have no place to lay it down; they carry it within. They take it to the place where it is converted into rage.

*****

To always wear a mask as a way of asserting masculine presence is to always live the lie, to be perpetually deprived of an authentic sense of identity and well-being.

*****

This falseness causes males to experience intense emotional pain. Rituals of domination help mediate the pain. They provide an illusory sense of self, an identity.

*****

Many men in our society have no status, no privilege;

*****

they receive no freely given compensation, no perks with capitalist patriarchy.

*****

For these men domination of women and children may be the only opportunity to assert a patriarchal presence. These men suffer. Their anguish and despair has no limits or boundaries.

*****

Rather than acknowledge the intensity of their suffering, they dissimulate. They pretend. They act as though they have power and privilege when they feel powerless.

*****

Like women, those who suffer the most cling to the very agents of their suffering, refusing to resist sexism or sexist oppression. Their refusal is rooted in the fear that their weakness will be exposed. They fear acknowledging the depths of their pain. As their pain intensifies, so does their need to do violence, to coercively dominate and abuse others.

*****

When feminist women insist that all men are powerful oppressors who victimize from the location of power, they obscure the reality that many victimize from the location of victimization. The violence they do to others is usually a mirroring of the violence enacted upon and within the self.

*****

To heal, men must learn to feel again. They must learn to break the silence, to speak the pain.

*****

Men of all ages who want to talk about feelings usually learn not to go to other men. And if they are heterosexual, they are far more likely to try sharing with women they have been sexually intimate with.

*****

Being “vulnerable” is an emotional state many men seek to avoid. Some men spend a lifetime in a state of avoidance and therefore never experience intimacy.

*****

In reality, the more patriarchal a man is, the more disconnected he must be from feeling. If he cannot feel, he cannot connect. If he cannot connect, he cannot be intimate.

*****

Most females are encouraged to learn relational skills, yet damaged self-esteem may prevent us from applying those skills in a healthy manner. If we are to begin to create a culture in which feminist masculinity can thrive, then women who mother will need to educate themselves for critical consciousness.

*****

Before most men can be intimate with others, they have to be intimate with themselves. They have to learn to feel and to be aware of their feelings. Men who mask feelings or suppress them simply do not want to feel the pain

*****

Shame at emotional vulnerability is often what men who are closed down emotionally seek to hide. Since shaming is often used to socialize boys away from their feeling selves toward the patriarchal male mask, many grown men have an internal shaming voice.

*****

Learning to wear a mask (that word already embedded in the term “masculinity”) is the first lesson in patriarchal masculinity that a boy learns. He learns that his core feelings cannot be expressed if they do not conform to the acceptable behaviors sexism defines as male.

*****

Sexist roles restrict the identity formation of male and female children, but the process is far more damaging to boys because not only are the roles required of them more rigid and confining, but they are much more likely to receive severe punishment when they deviate from these roles.

*****

Anyone who has a false self must be dishonest. People who learn to lie to themselves and others cannot love because they are crippled in their capacity to tell the truth and therefore unable to trust.

*****

Boys socialized to become patriarchs are being abused. As victims of child abuse via socialization in the direction of the patriarchal ideal, boys learn that they are unlovable

*****

Teaching boys to despise their vulnerability is one way to socialize them to engage in self-inflicted soul murder. This wound in the male spirit, caused by learned acts of splitting, of disassociation and disconnection, can only be healed by the practice of integrity.

Patriarchy encourages men to surrender their integrity and to live lives of denial. By learning the arts of compartmentalization, dissimulation, and disassociation, men are able to see themselves as acting with integrity in cases where they are not.

*****

Peck argues that compartmentalization is a way to avoid feeling pain: “We’re all familiar with the man who goes to church on Sunday morning, believing that he loves God and God’s creation and his fellow human beings, but who, on Monday morning, has no trouble with his company’s policy of dumping toxic wastes in the local stream. He can do this because he has religion in one compartment and his business in another.”

*****

All too often we are led to believe that men gain more power through lying and compartmentalization. It just simply is not so. The stress of guarding and protecting a false self is harmful to male emotional well-being;

*****

Much of the depression men suffer is directly related to their inability to be whole. Even though they have been socialized to create and maintain false selves, most men remember the true self that once existed. And it is that memory of loss—coupled with rage at the world, which encouraged the surrender of the self—that engenders depression.

*****

At the moment when addictions stop keeping the pain at bay, many men sink into depression. And as with so much male pain, it is only in recent years that men have been given societal permission to confront depression.

*****

Males are still being taught to keep it in and, worse, to deny that they feel like crying. Donald Dutton in his chapter “Love and Rage” says that male refusal to acknowledge loss is a key component of male rage:

*****

Male models for grieving are few…. Men in particular seem incapable of grieving and mourning on an individual basis. Perhaps that is why the blues are so popular with men. They serve a socially sanctioned form of expression for this lost and unattainable process…. When blues artist Robert Johnson sings, “I’ve been mis-treated and I don’t mind dying,” a multitude of men can feel their own unmet yearnings and nod in assent.

*****

Men need to mourn the old self and create the space for a new self to be born if they are to change and be wholly transformed.

*****

Only a father capable of being whole can have the integrity to acknowledge ignorance to his son without feeling diminished

*****

The competitive performance model of patriarchy teaches men who father that a son is or will be his adversary, that he has to fear the son’s stealing his glory.

*****

it is taking responsibility that sets me free.

*****

The patriarchal model that tells men that they must be in control at all times is at odds with cultivating the capacity to be responsible, which requires knowing when to control and when to surrender and let go.

*****

The ability to be forgiving is part of letting go of perfectionism and accepting vulnerability.

*****

At the same time, constructive criticism works only when it is linked to a process of affirmation. Giving affirmation is an act of emotional care.

*****

Critical analysis is useful when it promotes growth, but it is never enough. The work of affirmation is what brings us together. When men learn to affirm themselves and others, giving this soul care, then they are on the path to wholeness.

*****

This is the true meaning of reunion, living the knowledge that the damage can be repaired, that we can be whole again. It is the ultimate fulfillment that comes when men dare to challenge and change patriarchy.

*****

Calling attention to the fact that war has been not simply a male occupation but rather “an activity that has often served to define manhood itself,” Ehrenreich argues that “warfare and aggressive masculinity” are mutually reinforcing.

*****

resistance means opposition to being invaded, occupied, assaulted, and destroyed by the system.

*****

The purpose of resistance, here, is to seek the healing of yourself in order to be able to see clearly….

*****

In dominator cultures most families are not safe places. Dysfunction, intimate terrorism, and violence make them breeding grounds for war.

*****

Since we have yet to end patriarchal culture, our struggles to end domination must begin where we live, in the communities we call home.

*****

If we are to create a culture in which all males can learn to love, we must first reimagine family in all its diverse forms as a place of resistance.

*****

To create the culture that will enable boys to love, we must see the family as having as its primary function the giving of love (providing food and shelter are loving acts).

*****

Learning how to love in family life, boys (and girls) learn the relational skills needed to build community at home and in the world.

*****

If we are lucky enough as children to be surrounded by grown-ups who love us, then our sense of wholeness is not just the sense of completeness in ourselves but also is the sense of belonging to others and to our place; it is an unconscious awareness of community, of having in common. It may be that this double sense of singular integrity and of communal belonging is our personal standard of health for as long as we live…we

*****

To make this solid foundation, men must set the example by daring to heal, by daring to do the work of relational recovery. Irrespective of their sexual preferences, men in the process of self-recovery usually begin by returning to boyhood and evaluating what they learned about masculinity and how they learned it

*****

Men are on the path to love when they choose to become emotionally aware.

*****

“Emotional awareness is more than applying techniques to this circumstance or that circumstance. It is a natural expression of an orientation that turns your attention toward the most noble, fulfilling, joyful, and empowering part of yourselves that you can reach for. That is your soul.”

The love women are looking for in relationships with men is one based on mutuality in

Women want to be recognized, seen, and cared about by the men in our lives.

We desire respect whether gender equality exists in all areas or not

Love cannot coexist with domination.

Men will never receive support from patriarchal culture for their emotional development.

*****

As individual men have become more aware of the lovelessness in their lives, they have also recognized their longing for love. This recognition does not mean that men know what to do.

*****

In a world where men love, a focus on eros and eroticism will naturally replace male obsession with sex.

“The pornographic utopia is a world of abundance, abandon, and autonomy—a world, in short, utterly unlike the one we inhabit….

Most men don’t feel especially good about themselves, living lives of ‘quiet desperation.’…Pornographic

*****

Damaged in that openhearted place where they could imagine freely, men must undergo a healing restoration of the will to imagine before they can break with a model of sexuality that breeds addiction while denying them access to a sexuality that satisfies.

*****

Directly and indirectly, we are handed sexuality as the one vehicle through which it might still be possible to express and experience essential aspects of our humanness that have been slowly and systematically conditioned out of us.

*****

Suggesting that men resist repression and choose passion as they reclaim their feeling lives, Bearman identifies passion as the “greatest ally” men can choose in their efforts to liberate their complete humanity.

*****

The root meaning of the Latin word patior is “to suffer.” To claim passion, men must

*****

embrace the pain, feel the suffering, moving through it to the world of pleasure that awaits.

*****

In loving sexual intimacy, sexual partners are not interchangeable.

*****

If all men were in touch with primal positive passion, the categories of gay and straight would lose their charged significance.

*****

Patriarchy has sought to repress and tame erotic passion precisely because of its power to draw us into greater and greater communion with ourselves, with those we know most intimately, and with the stranger.

*****

We cannot turn our hearts away from boys and men, then ponder why the politics of war continues to shape our national policy and our intimate romantic lives.

*****

As feminist thinking and practice loses visibility, many females look to patriarchy for their salvation.

*****

The work of male relational recovery, of reconnection, of forming intimacy and making community can never be done alone.

*****

Healing does not take place in isolation.
